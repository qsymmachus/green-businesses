Alameda County Green Business: search by name
================

Alameda county certifies local businesses that conserve energy and water, minimize waste, and reduce their carbon footprints. Unless businesses advertise their "green certified" status however, there is no easy way to identify certified businesses. 

A few apps have already been made to address this problem. Jon Wu's <a href="http://www.jonwu.me/greenbyme.html">"Green by me"</a> maps green businesses near a user organized by sector. Alameda county has an <a href="http://acgov.org/mobile/services/greenbiz/">official app</a> that allows users to search green businesses by city and sector. 

I thought that these apps, while useful, lacked a core feature: the ability to search for green certified businesses by name. This app implements that feature within an appealing front-end interface. 

It's been deployed to heroku: <a href="http://acgreenbusinesses.herokuapp.com/">acgreenbusinesses.herokuapp.com</a>
